## Stop Chasing Payments, Start Automating Results

Tired of manually checking for late payments and sending repetitive emails? Fakturo's **Automatic Payment Reminders** system takes the awkwardness out of debt collection by handling follow-ups for you.

### 1. Customizable Reminder Schedules
Set up multiple reminder rules based on the due date of your invoices. Choose from "friendly" pre-due date reminders, on-the-day notifications, or more urgent overdue follow-ups. You define the timing and the frequency.

### 2. Personalized Messaging
Each reminder email can be fully customized with your own brand voice. Use our smart tags to automatically include client names, invoice numbers, total amounts, and even direct payment links for immediate action.

### 3. Integrated Payment Links
Make it as easy as possible for your clients to pay. Every reminder includes a direct link to the invoice in their secure client portal, where they can pay immediately via Stripe or their preferred payment method.

### 4. Smart Rules & Exclusion
- **Auto-Stop:** Reminders automatically stop the moment an invoice is marked as paid.
- **Client Exclusions:** Easily disable reminders for specific clients or individual invoices.
- **Late Fees:** Automatically calculate and include late payment penalties for overdue accounts.

### Business Advantages
- **Improve Cash Flow:** Get paid an average of 12 days faster with proactive reminders.
- **Save Time:** Reclaim hours of administrative time spent on manual follow-ups.
- **Maintain Relationships:** Professional, automated reminders are often more effective and less confrontational than manual calls.
