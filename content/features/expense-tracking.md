## Take the Pain Out of Expense Management

Stop collecting crumpled receipts and spending hours at the end of the month reconciling your accounts. Fakturo's **Expense Tracking** feature allows you to capture business spending as it happens, ensuring your books are always up-to-date and tax-ready.

### 1. Simple Expense Capture
Log expenses in seconds from any device. Categorize each transaction by type (travel, supplies, utilities, etc.), assign it to a specific client or project, and attach a digital copy of the receipt for total transparency.

### 2. Digital Receipt Archiving
Go paperless with our secure digital archive. Every expense can have its original receipt attached, which is then stored in an AEAT-compliant format. Never worry about losing a deductible receipt again.

### 3. Automated VAT Recovery
Fakturo automatically extracts and calculates the VAT (IVA) from your expenses. See exactly how much input tax you can offset against your sales, helping you manage your cash flow and prepare for quarterly tax filings (Form 303) with ease.

### 4. Smart Spending Insights
- **Categorized Spending:** See exactly where your money is going with intuitive charts and reports.
- **Budget Monitoring:** Track expenses against your projects to ensure you're staying profitable.
- **Supplier Tracking:** Manage your regular suppliers and analyze your spending patterns over time.

### Business Advantages
- **Maximize Deductions:** Never miss a tax-deductible expense again.
- **Real-Time Visibility:** Know your true profit margins at any moment.
- **Audit Preparedness:** Maintain a perfectly organized digital paper trail for your gestor or the tax authorities.
